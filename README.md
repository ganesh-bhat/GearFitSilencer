# GearFitSilencer
An application for Samsung Galaxy Gear Fit1 ( uses CUPS SDK )

Helps to silence your phone for specific period of time using your smart watch. Super helpful when you are attending meeting or when in cinema. 
You do get nofication when phone is coming back to full volume and allows user to set into silent mode again.

This avoids anyone putting phone into silent mode for long time and missing lot of phone calls.

Same is posted to android play store.
